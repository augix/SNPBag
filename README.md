# Overview
SNPBag is a large language model pre-trained with whole-genome SNP data from 1 million synthetic individuals. It is currently fine-tuned for 4 tasks:
- genotype imputation
- haplotype phasing
- population classification
- relatedness inference

# Demo
Under construction, not 100% finished. Take a peek at [http://guohuaxu.com:5000](http://guohuaxu.com:5000).
